Hi, I'm Keyon (Kean Chen), still in the process of self-development. 

I read about all kinds of things, while Albert Camus and George Orwell left me a profound impression; I like watching movies, TV shows, anime, open course and especially David Adenburgâ€™s documentaries; As a big fan of Eminem, I like rap and electronic music; I have tried many sports, among which fitness, breaking and table tennis are the most rewarding. Sichuan Province Table Tennis Doubles Champion should be the pinnacle of my career.

The original purpose of setting up this blog is not only to record some of my experiences and thoughts, but also it can let me look back to see my changes after many years. The mediums for recording are articles, photos and videos: articles contain my personal thoughts, learning notes, book reviews, film reviews and other contents, hoping they still have value of reference after 5 years; the content of photos and videos is mainly about me and my life.

That's all.
